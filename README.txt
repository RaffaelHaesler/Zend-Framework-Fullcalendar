This calendar module is part of a larger application I built in Zend Framework.  

The calendar uses Full Calendar jQuery plugin (http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/). This 
module allows a user to create/read/update/delete an event and the events themselves are 
organized into groups.

There is also an ical function that allows a specially crafted URL to obtain ical
events for one or several groups.

The back end data storage is using Doctrine ORM to connect to a MySQL db.

The full calendar can be viewed in action at
